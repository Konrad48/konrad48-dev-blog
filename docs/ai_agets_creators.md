# AI Agent Workflow Tools

A curated list of local open-source tools for creating and managing AI agent workflows, that I have tried and tested

### Flowise
https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise

Open source tool based on langchain, created with node.js and Vue

**Pros**:
- Simple UI
- Lots of pre built templates

**Cons**:
- Sidebar with tools hides after crating nodes
- Editing of texts in nodes not very intuitive
- Does not output source code

### Langflow
https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow

Based on Python and React

**Pros**:
- More advanced and polished UI
- More advanced options


**Cons**:
- Sometimes laggy and slow
- Setop is more painfull than Flowise's


### n8n
https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n

Advanced, and quite capable but have not explored it in details yet.
